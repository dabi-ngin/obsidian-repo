#Philosophy 

Philosophy of mind centres on what it means to think and what thinking in of itself is. This topic ranges broadly from the concepts of limited existence via global scepticism through famous authors like [[Ren√© Descartes]] with idioms like "cogito ergo sum", and virtual realities from more contemporary philosophers like [[David Chalmers]]. 

The nature of thought and what understanding means is also explored by some more modern philosophers like [[Searle]]
