Parsing is the process of taking a sequence of tokens as input and building an [[Abstract Syntax Tree]]. 
Utilised by both [[Interpreters]] and [[Compilers]], these form some of the most fundamental portions of code interpretation and compilation respectively. Parsing is in essence the act of turning tokens into [[Context-Free Grammars]].
