Compilers are tools which execute a series of steps which take human readable language and **compile** it down to [[Machine Code]] or [[Bytecode]] in order for a machine to execute it.. This allows it to run significantly faster in most cases, but this comes at the cost of paying time up front to compile the code down from text.
